He has been afebrile for 36 hours. Review the de-escalation plan: ceftriaxone dose in CKD, vancomycin discontinuation criteria, total antibiotic duration for bacteremic UTI, and what monitoring continues after de-escalation. (4) Interprofessional coordination is essential for optimal patient outcomes in this case type."
