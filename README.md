# ReasonDx

A comprehensive clinical reasoning trainer for medical students. Practice diagnostic thinking through realistic patient scenarios with gamification, spaced repetition, and evidence-based feedback.

## Features

### 🩺 Clinical Case Simulator
Work through **200+ patient cases** across multiple specialties:
- Build differential diagnoses from chief complaints
- Categorize diagnoses as "Most Likely," "Must Not Miss," and "Less Likely"
- Gather targeted history using the OLDCARTS framework
- Perform focused physical examinations
- Order and interpret diagnostic workup (labs, imaging, procedures)
- Receive detailed feedback with teaching points and key findings

### 📞 Consult Trainer (SBAR Practice)
Practice calling consults with **13 realistic scenarios**:
- Review patient data and identify key findings
- Construct SBAR presentations (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)
- Compare your presentation against model answers
- Covers ED, floor, and ICU settings

### 📋 Quick Reference Cards
**47 clinical decision tools** at your fingertips:
- Diagnostic criteria (Wells DVT/PE, PERC, Ottawa Ankle/Knee)
- Risk stratification (HEART, CURB-65, Glasgow-Blatchford, CHADS₂-VASc)
- Management guidelines (tPA criteria, RCRI, antibiotic selection)
- Calculators (A-a gradient, corrected sodium/calcium, MELD)

### 🖼️ Image Quiz
Practice interpreting:
- ECGs (MI patterns, arrhythmias, blocks)
- Chest X-rays (pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax)
- CT scans (PE, stroke, appendicitis)
- Dermatology images
