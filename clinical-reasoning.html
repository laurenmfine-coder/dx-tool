It gets worse after I eat, especially spicy foods, and when I lie down at night. Tums help a little but it keeps coming back. I've also noticed my stools have been darker than usual - almost black. I take ibuprofen every day for my back pain - have for years. I drink a couple beers most nights and probably too much coffee. I smoke about half a pack a day. My doctor told me I have high blood pressure but I ran out of my medication a few weeks ago."`,

It was bright red, and there was some blood coating the outside of the stool too - the water in the toilet was light pink. It doesn't hurt when I go, but I've been straining a lot because I've been constipated for about 3 months now. I used to go every day, but now it's maybe every 3-4 days. My job changed about 4 months ago - I'm a flight attendant now so I'm traveling a lot and eating airport food, not drinking enough water. I haven't noticed this before. Oh, and my father had colon cancer when he was 50."`,

It's right in the center of my chest, kind of burning or squeezing. At first I thought it was just indigestion because it sometimes happened after big meals. But lately it's happening when I walk up stairs or carry groceries - even without eating. It lasts about 5-10 minutes and goes away when I rest. Sometimes it spreads to my left shoulder and jaw. I get a little short of breath and tired when it happens. I've had some acid reflux before but this feels different - stronger. My dad had a heart attack in his 60s. I have diabetes - been on metformin for 10 years - and high blood pressure. I take lisinopril but sometimes forget. Work has been stressful lately."`,

It gets worse when I take a deep breath, when I move my left arm, or when I press on my chest. It doesn't radiate anywhere. I haven't had any shortness of breath, no sweating, no nausea. I'm pretty healthy - I work out 4-5 times a week. I don't smoke, no family history of heart problems. I'm not on any medications.

I used to walk my dog around the block no problem, but now I have to stop once or twice to catch my breath. Even walking from the parking lot makes me winded now. At night I need two pillows or I can't breathe, and twice this week I woke up gasping and had to sit up. My ankles have been swelling, especially by evening. I also get this tight feeling in my chest when I walk uphill - goes away when I stop. I'm feeling really tired and a little lightheaded. I ran out of my water pill last week and haven't refilled it. I had a heart attack about 6 years ago and they told me I had mild heart failure after. I take ibuprofen for my knee pain a few times a week. Oh, and I flew home from visiting my daughter 3 weeks ago - about a 5-hour flight. I also recently started hormone therapy for menopause."`,

I've never been told I had high blood pressure before, but I admit I haven't seen a doctor in years. I feel fine - no headaches, no chest pain, no shortness of breath.

These changes alone can lower your blood pressure by 10-15 points. But given that your heart is already showing effects, I'm also going to start you on a blood pressure medication today. We'll check some blood and urine tests, and I want you to follow up in 2-4 weeks so we can see how you're responding.",

I feel this pressure under my eyes and get headaches, especially when I bend forward. No real fever - maybe 99-100 at the highest. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. My ears feel kind of plugged but not painful. I've been taking DayQuil and NyQuil and some saline spray which helps a little. My kid had a cold last week so I probably caught it from them. I get seasonal allergies but this feels different. I'm worried it might be turning into something worse like pneumonia."`,

I've been vegetarian for years and don't eat much red meat. Here's the strange thing - I've been craving ice constantly. I just want to chew on ice all day. I know that's weird. My periods have always been heavy - usually last about a week with lots of pad changes. Oh, and I've been feeling cold all the time lately and gained about 5 pounds. I stopped taking my water pill about a month ago because it made me pee too much at night."`,

The pain is constant and severe, like a 9 out of 10. I've been nauseous and threw up twice. I can't find any position that makes it better. I've felt a little feverish. I have a history of an ovarian cyst on my right side - they found it on ultrasound about 6 months ago and said to just watch it. My last period was 2 weeks ago and was normal. I have an IUD for birth control. I don't have any vaginal bleeding or discharge. The pain is so bad I can barely walk."`,

                    oldcartsNarrative: `"The pain started last night, about 2 hours after dinner. We had fried chicken and fries - pretty greasy. At first it was crampy but then became sharp and constant. It's in my upper right belly and goes to my right shoulder blade. It's been about 7 out of 10, but earlier it was 9 out of 10. It hurts to take deep breaths and when you press on it. I feel nauseous and threw up once this morning. I felt feverish with chills overnight. This has actually happened before - I've had 2 or 3 episodes like this in the past year after heavy meals, but they went away on their own after a few hours. This one hasn't gone away. My mom had her gallbladder out at 45 - I'm worried it's the same thing."`,

Once we get you hydrated and the vomiting under control, you'll start feeling much better.",

This explains all your symptoms - the frequent urination, the thirst, the weight loss, the yeast infections, and the blurry vision are all caused by high blood sugar.",
                        plan: "The good news is this is very treatable. I'm starting you on a medication called metformin that will help your body use insulin better and lower your blood sugar. You'll need to check your blood sugar at home - we'll give you a glucometer today. I'm also setting you up with our diabetes educator who will teach you about diet, monitoring, and managing this condition. And you'll need an eye exam to make sure your eyes are okay.",
                        warningsToDiscuss: "Come back right away if you develop severe nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, if you feel confused or very drowsy, or if you have trouble breathing. These could be signs your blood sugar is dangerously high.",
                        addressingConcerns: "I know a diabetes diagnosis can feel overwhelming. But with good management, people with diabetes live full, healthy lives. Your dad has lived with diabetes for years. The key is taking it seriously, taking your medication, and making some lifestyle changes. You caught this relatively early, which is actually good news."

                        diagnosis: "Ms. Torres, we've found the cause of your missed periods and the nipple discharge. You have a benign tumor in your pituitary gland - a small gland at the base of your brain. This type of tumor is called a prolactinoma, and it's producing too much of a hormone called prolactin, which is why you're having the symptoms you described. The tumor is also pressing on the nerves for your vision, which explains why you've been having trouble seeing things to the sides.",
                        plan: "The good news is that this type of tumor usually responds very well to medication - we don't need surgery. I'm starting you on a medication called cabergoline that will shrink the tumor and bring your prolactin level back to normal. Most women see their periods return and the discharge stop within a few months. We'll repeat the MRI in 3 months to make sure the tumor is shrinking, and we'll have ophthalmology follow your vision.",
                        warningsToDiscuss: "Call us if you have a sudden severe headache, sudden vision changes, or nausea and vomiting - these could indicate a problem with the tumor that needs urgent attention.",
                        addressingConcerns: "I know hearing you have a 'brain tumor' is scary, but I want to reassure you - prolactinomas are benign, meaning they're not cancer. They don't spread, and they respond beautifully to medication in most cases. Your vision should improve as the tumor shrinks. And yes, you should be able to have children in the future once this is controlled."
